
# Given two words word1 and word2, find the minimum number of steps
# required to make word1 and word2 the same, where in each step you can
# delete one character in either string.
#
# Example 1: Input: "sea", "eat"
# Output: 2
# Explanation: You need one step to make "sea" to "ea" and another step to make "eat" to "ea".

# Very Simple Idea that the number of deletions is equal to the number of places where both strings are different.
# So simply find the longest common subsequence(alphabets common in both in the same order) and â€‹subtract it from
# both the strings to find the elements that have to be deleted
