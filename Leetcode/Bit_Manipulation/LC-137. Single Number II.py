
# Given a non-empty array of integers, every element appears three times except for one, which appears exactly once. Find that single one.
#
# Note:
#
# Your algorithm should have a linear runtime complexity. Could you implement it without using extra memory?
#
# Example 1:
#
# Input: [2,2,3,2]
# Output: 3
