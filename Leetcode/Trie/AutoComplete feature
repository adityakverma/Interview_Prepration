We are given a Trie with a set of strings stored in it. Now the user types in a prefix of his search query, we need to give him all recommendations to auto-complete his query based on the strings stored in the Trie. We assume that the Trie stores past searches by the users.

For example if the Trie store {“abc”, “abcd”, “aa”, “abbbaba”} and the User types in “ab” then he must be shown {“abc”, “abcd”, “abbbaba”}.

Prerequisite Trie Search and Insert.



Given a query prefix, we search for all words having this query.

    Search for given query using standard Trie search algorithm.
    If query prefix itself is not present, return -1 to indicate the same.
    If query is present and is end of word in Trie, print query. This can quickly checked by seeing if last matching node has isEndWord flag set. We use this flag in Trie to mark end of word nodes for purpose of searching.
    If last matching node of query has no children, return.
    Else recursively print all nodes under subtree of last matching node.
